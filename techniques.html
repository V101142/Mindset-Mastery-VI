        <h2>1. Mindful Breathing</h2>
        <p>Mindful breathing is a simple yet effective technique. Find a quiet place, sit comfortably, and focus your attention on your breath. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, then exhale through your mouth. Notice the sensation of the breath as it enters and leaves your body. If your mind wanders, gently bring your focus back to your breath.</p>

        <h2>2. Body Scan Meditation</h2>
        <p>Body scan meditation involves paying close attention to each part of your body. Start at your toes and work your way up to your head, noticing any tension or sensations along the way. As you become more aware of your body, you can release tension and promote relaxation. This technique is great for reducing physical stress.</p>
